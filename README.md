# Google Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike Share

This repository contains my R analysis of a dataset from Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago. This is with the focus of finding differences between casual riders and members amongst the company's users. Visualizations and insights are also provided within the links below. 

# Background

Cyclistic is a bike-share program in Chicago featuring over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. These bikes can be unlocked from a docking station and returned to any station at any given time. Cyclistic riders tend to ride for leisure purposes, but about 30% use their bikes for commuting to work. 	

Prior to this project, Cyclistic had relied their marketing on building awarenesss and appealing to broad consumer topics. To support this marketing, pricing plans including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships were offered to consumers. From this, customers purchasing single-ride or full-day passes were groups as casual riders and customers purchasing annual memberships were grouped as members of Cyclistic. Financial analysts of the Cyclistic team have deemed annual members as more profitable than casual riders. Marketinhg director, Lily Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be important in leading future growth. With this, Moreno is looking for ways to convert casual riders into annual members as a new strategy for marketing.
